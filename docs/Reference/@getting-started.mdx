## Base URL

For starters, every API request must start with the following base URL:

```
https://top.gg/api/
```

## Authentication

To access our API, you need to authorize yourself by using an API token, which can be obtained in your project's edit page. It's recommended for you to use a newer API token over the legacy one, as newer API tokens let you use the [v1 endpoints](v1-endpoints.mdx).

<br/>
This API token can later be used in your request's `Authorization` header. For example:

```js
const response = await fetch('https://top.gg/api/bots/stats', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({ server_count: 1 }),
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.TOPGG_TOKEN}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  }
})

console.log(response.status)
```
