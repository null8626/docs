With webhooks, you can get notified from the Top.gg server in near real-time. This eliminates the need to call our API directly every time you want to check something, which could easily hit ratelimits. Basically, the Top.gg server will attempt to send a `POST` request to a recipient URL of your choice whenever a certain event has just fired (like receiving a vote,) then your server validates this request and processes the data we sent with your own logic!

It should be noted that Top.gg webhooks are **not** the same as Discord webhooks. You would need to implement **your own** logic to be able to send Top.gg events to Discord.

## Setting up

For example, let's say you have an express app like this:

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use(express.json());

// highlight-start
app.post('/votes', (req, res) => {
  // ...
});
// highlight-end

app.listen(8080, () => console.log('Server running on port 8080'));
```

To set up your webhook, open the webhooks section in your bot/server's Top.gg page settings, and enter your full recipient URL in the `Webhook URL` box. In your example, it's `https://yourserver.com/votes`.

### Authentication

Your webhook endpoint also need to validate incoming requests in order to differentiate which request is really coming from Top.gg and which is just bogus. This way, you can help prevent abuse in case your webhook endpoint gets leaked.

This is possible by using secrets (or passwords.) Essentially, you make up your secret password, tell Top.gg that it needs to send requests to your server with this password, and your server validates it upon receiving a request. Make sure to not share this password with anyone else!

To achieve this, you can enter your custom secret/password in the `Authorization` box under the `Webhook URL` box. After clicking save, you can add the password to your server's environment variables (for example `MY_TOPGG_WEBHOOK_SECRET`) and validate incoming requests like so:

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// highlight-next-line
const TOPGG_WEBHOOK_SECRET = process.env.MY_TOPGG_WEBHOOK_SECRET;

app.use(express.json());

app.post('/votes', (req, res) => {
  // highlight-start
  if (req.headers['Authorization'] === TOPGG_WEBHOOK_SECRET) {
    return res.sendStatus(204);
  } else {
    return res.sendStatus(401);
  }
  // highlight-end
});

app.listen(8080, () => console.log('Server running on port 8080'));
```

Now, your server's Top.gg webhook endpoint is properly secured! Incoming requests that carries your password will be authenticated and receive a `204` (No Content) status code, while invalid requests will receive a `401` (Unauthorized) status code instead, *womp womp!*

### IP

If your server is running a firewall, you can whitelist the following IP which represents our server sending webhook data to your webhook endpoint:

```
59.203.105.187
```

## Acknowledgement

Make sure that your webhook endpoint is able to acknowledge our webhook request by returning `2xx` response within 5 seconds.

If your server is unable to meet this demand, our server will retry by sending the same request 10 times. The retry delay is increased exponentially per retry by `2^n` seconds, from a minimum delay of 1 second for the first retry up to 17 minutes for the tenth.

:::note
If your server returns a `4xx` status code, our server will **not** send retry requests because these are considered user errors.

## Data structure

We carry the webhook event data to you inside the request's JSON body. This data's contents depends on the webhook type you selected.

### Votes

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="bot" label="Bot" default>
    This is the data we carry whenever a user has voted for your bot. It is structured like this:

    <Tabs>
      <TabItem value="table" label="Table" default>
        | Field       | Type        | Description                                                                                                                                                          |
        | ----------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
        | `bot`       | `snowflake` | Discord ID of the bot that received a vote.                                                                                                                          |
        | `user`      | `snowflake` | Discord ID of the user who voted.                                                                                                                                    |
        | `type`      | `string`    | The vote type. If the event is fired manually from your behalf via a "test" button in the Top.gg page settings, it will be `test`. Otherwise, it will be `"upvote"`. |
        | `isWeekend` | `boolean`   | Whether the weekend multiplier is active, where a single vote counts as two.                                                                                         |
        | `query`?    | `string`    | Query string parameters found in the `/bot/:bot_id/vote` page URL. For example: `?a=1&b=2`.                                                                          |
      </TabItem>
      <TabItem value="json" label="JSON example">
        ```json
        {
          "bot": "1026525568344264724",
          "user": "661200758510977084",
          "type": "test",
          "isWeekend": false
        }
        ```
      </TabItem>
    </Tabs>
