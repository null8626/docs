title: Ratelimits
description: Top.gg API's endpoint ratelimits
---

The Top.gg API imposes a ratelimiting mechanism to limit and prevent spam requests.

## Global ratelimits

Global ratelimits are imposed on **all routes** (`*`) regardless of HTTP method (`GET`, `POST`). **These endpoints should receive more than `100` requests per second.**

## Resource-specific ratelimits

Certain endpoints have tighter restrictions on their ratelimits. Note that global ratelimits **will still** apply to requests sent to these endpoints.

| Route     | HTTP method  | Max requests           |
| --------- | ------------ | ---------------------- |
| `/bots/*` | `*`          | 60 requests per minute |

## Exceeding a ratelimit

If you exceed a set ratelimit, you will **receive a `429` status code** and be **blocked from requesting to our API for one hour**. Meanwhile, in the HTTP response, you will receive a `Retry-After` header which represents the time needed **in seconds** before you are able to send requests again. You can learn more about this header [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Retry-After).
